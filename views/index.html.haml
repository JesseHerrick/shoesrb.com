        %p
          Ever wanted to build a GUI? Annoyed that it's so much effort? Shoes
          makes building for Mac, Windows, and Linux <em>super</em> simple.

          %p
            Basically, making desktop applications is really annoying. There's
            so many details to take care of, and you'd really rather just be
            building your application. Shoes handles doing all of the
            cross-platform stuff for you, and gives you native widgets on each
            platform.

            If you're already using Shoes, you'll probably need to look things
            up from time to time. There's a manual in Shoes already, but if
            you prefer to look things up on the web, we've also provided a
            manual for you as well.

            We're going to write from time to time about what's new in
            Shoes-land. It's not quite ready yet, but we'll be unveilling it
            in the near future. Keep up with the latest developments, see what
            other people are building, and hear about new features as we build
            them!
