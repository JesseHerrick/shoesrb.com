<p>
<p>We had the first of our monthly Google Hangouts to talk about Shoes 4 this past Tuesday. It was great to meet everyone, and it was super exciting to talk about all the different things regarding Shoes.

<p>We decided to continue holding our Google Hangouts the first Tuesday of every month at 1600 UTC for an hour at most, so our next one will be November 5th at 1600 UTC. Feel free to add Shoes to your circles on [Google Hangouts](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/115048537762125064206/115048537762125064206/posts), and we'll post the link to join the Hangout on there :)

  * Newcomers are definitely welcome! We can talk about what you can work on and guide you in the right direction if you need help.

  * You can also feel free to just listen in too. You can mute your microphone throughout and chime in if you feel like it.

  * We've got [9 issues](https://github.com/shoes/shoes4/issues?milestone=2&state=open) remaining for the alpha release. We'll try to touch on the remaining issues during the Hangouts until we're ready for the alpha release.

    * You can also post on the G+ page or bring it up in the Hangout if you want to talk about a specific issue.

<p>Thanks to Davor, Tobi, Eric, James, and Sebastjan for hanging out with us this past month and the great conversation that ensued! Hope you all can make it again next month!

<p>For those that can't make it, we'll be using [Hangouts on Air](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/115048537762125064206/115048537762125064206/videos) to put the videos on Youtube for anyone who wants to check out our talks.

<p>Shoes on and see you all next month! :)
